StupidPlayer version 0.3
------------------------

Simple MP3 Player for eQ ARM DDS.
It should also work happilly on RiscStation 7500, Mico and A7000+.

With 11025Hz 16bit stereo output, it should be ok up to about 72000ko/sec video modes.
It is working well under the following resolutions :
640x480x32@60
800x600x16@72
1024x768x8@70
1280x1024x8@54
So understand that it works on every usable resolutions (anyway, in other modes the computer becomes really too slow).

With 22050Hz 16bit stereo output, it should be ok up to about 36000ko/sec video modes.
It is working well under the following resolutions :
640x480x16@60
800x600x8@72
1024x768x4@70
1280x1024x4@54
See !Run file to switch between 11, 22 and 44 KHz modes.

44100Hz mode doesn't work for now (but is it really usefull anyway since 22050 mode is really perfect ?).

All test are done with 128kbps files (vbr and 192kbps files need smaller resolutions). Computer is configured to use 50ns memory (even if ours is 60ns).

Tricks :
--------
You can make modes with smaller frame rate (for example 1024x768@65), it will help a lot with complex files (the key problem is bandwith, not really processing power).

Put that on your mimemap file ($.!Boot.Resources.!Internet.files.MimeMap)
audio/mpeg			MPEG		1ad	.mp3
Press F12 and Type : ReadMimeMap... It's usefull for CD-Rom.

Jukebox mode :
--------------
Uncheck the right option in !Run file (and check the others)
Use a text editor (example for StrongED)
1 - Open a new Obey File (right click on StrongED icon)
2 - Shift drag all the wanted files
3 - Select all...
4 - Do a "Bloc - Process - Sort", if necessary.
5 - Save (F3)
You can now run your playlist with a simple click.

History :
---------
29 may 2001 - dct64 optimisations, for a big performance gain.
              support for skipping ID3 tag and normal ending
20 may 2001 - Added correct exit from player.
18 may 2001 - Now for sound use native sound SWI(v0.2).

This software is placed under GNU/GPL licence.

None bugs :
-----------
If you quit the player, the dynamic area is not always freed -> We work on it.
Some mp3 with curious headers will not work -> Should be OK...

To compile :
------------
Use "amu".
It will need, latest 32 bits library and oslib.
Included Absolute files are squeezed so don't worry about the size of yours :)
